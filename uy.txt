Day 1

1]   Input your name into a variable called $name and then print "Hello, <your name here>".	

name='kedar'
print("hello",name)

2]   Write a program that adds two numbers and then prints out
     whether the sum of those two numbers is positive or negative.

a=int(input('enter your first no.'))
b=int(input('enter your second no.'))
c=a+b
print(c)
if (c>0):
  print('positive')
else:
  print('negative')

3]    Write a program that stores a number and keeps trying to get user input
      until the user enters the number correctly. As soon as the correct number is entered, it prints: Correct!

a=int(input('enter your no. here '))
if (a>30):
  print('correct')
else:
  print('enter your no. again')

4]    Input your first name and last name as two separate variables, 
      labeled as $firstname and $lastname respectively. 
      Concatenate them together using the dot operator '.' into a new variable called $wholename. 
      Then print out the $wholename.

firstname='kedar'
lastname='bole'
wholename= ('{} {}' .format(firstname,lastname))
print(wholename)

or


firstname="kedar"
lastname="bole"
wholename=" ".join([firstname,lastname])
print(wholename)


5]    Write a program to accept an input string from the user and toggle the character cases.
      For example, $str=” Hello How Are You?”
      O/p : hELLO hOW aRE yOU

str=input('enter the string here')
toogled=(str.swapcase())
print(toogled)


6]     Write a program which will perform sum and multiplication ,that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers
       in a list of numbers. For example, sum([1, 2, 3, 4]) should return 10, 
       and multiply([1, 2, 3, 4]) should return 24.

a=[1,3,7,9]
sum=0
mul=1
for i in a:
  sum+=i
  mul*=i
print(sum,mul)

7] (doubt)    Write a program that takes a value (i.e. a number, string, etc) x and a list of values a, 
      and returns True if x is a member of a, False otherwise. 
      (Note that this is exactly what the in operator does, but for the sake of the exercise you should pretend 
      Python did not have this operator.)

a=int(input('enter a value'))
lst= []
a=int(input('enter thr no. of elements'))
for i in range(a):
  b=input('enter the values')
  lst.append(b)

for i in lst:

  if (i==a):
    print('match found',i)
  else:
    print('no match found')


8. Write a program that has two lists and print True if they have at least one member in common, False otherwise. 
   You may use your is_member() function, or the in operator, but for the sake of the exercise, 
   you should (also) write it using two nested for-loops.

a=[1,2,3,4]
b=[4,5,6,7]

for i in a :
  for y in b:
    if(i==y):
      print(i,"true")
    else:
      print(i,y,'false')

9]  Write a program for histogram that takes a list of integers and prints a histogram to the screen. 
    For example, histogram([4, 9, 7]) should print the following:
    ****
    *********
    *******

lst=[]
a=int(input('enter the no. of elements'))

for i in range(0,a):
  b=int(input('enter your value'))
  lst.append(b)
print(lst)

for i in lst:
  print('*'*i)


10] List of athletes participated in 100m and 200m running race
a. hundred_meters = [‘Vikay’,’John’,’Kumar’,’Rajesh’,’Malar’,’Vaihai’]
b. two_hundred_meters = [‘Vetry’,’Petter’,’Priyanka’,’Kumar’,’Malar’]

Find the answer for below question from above lists (using set and Boolean Operators)
a. Find the athletes who participated only in 100m race
b. Find the athletes who participated only in 200m race
c. Find the athletes who participated both 100m and 200m race
d. Find the athletes who participated only one race

a]hm={'v','jhn','kmr','rjs','mlr','vh'}
thn={'v','p','prk','kmr','mlr'}

hm.difference(thn)

b]hm={'v','jhn','kmr','rjs','mlr','vh'}
thn={'v','p','prk','kmr','mlr'}

thn.difference(hm)

c]hm={'v','jhn','kmr','rjs','mlr','vh'}
thn={'v','p','prk','kmr','mlr'}

thn.intersection(hm)

d] hm={'v','jhn','kmr','rjs','mlr','vh'}
thn={'v','p','prk','kmr','mlr'}

a=thn.intersection(hm)
b= hm.union(thn)
b.difference(a)


11. Find the duplicate numbers from below list
    List = [5, 8,4,18,8,55,6,8,3,18,5,3,44,]

a=[5,8,4,18,8,55,6,8,3,18,5,3,44]
b=[]
for i in a:
 if i not in b:
  b.append(i)
 else:
   print(i)




12. Reverse the below list without using any inbuilt keywords
    (like reverse() or [::-1])
List = ["cat","tiger","lion", "zebra" , "crocodile", "snack"]












class Student:
    def __init__(self, name,age):   #(std, tushar, 40)
        self.fname=name                # std.fname  = "tushar"
        self.fage=age                   # std.age  = 40
        
 
    def message(self):
        print("hey this is a mesage", self.fname)
 
std1 = Student("tushar",40)
 
std1.message()
 
std2 = Student("Joy",50)
std2.message()












4. Input your first name and last name as two separate variables,
 labeled as $firstname and $lastname respectively.
Concatenate them together using the dot operator '.' into a new variable called $wholename. 
Then print out the $wholename. 
Ans]
 firstname='kedar'
lastname='bole'
wholename =firstname+lastname
print(wholename)

or

firstname='s1'
lastnmae='s2'
k="".join([firstname,lastnmae])
print(k)


5] Write a program to accept an input string from the user and toggle the character cases.
 For example, $str=” Hello How Are You?” O/p : hELLO hOW aRE yOU 
Ans]
a=input('enter your string here:')
print(a.swapcase())



l, u, s, d = 0, 0, 0, 0
p = input()
if (9< len(p) <= 15):
for i in p:
 
if (i.islower()):
 l=l+1
 
if (i.isupper()):
 u=u+1
 
if (i.isdigit()):
 d=d+1
 
if (i=='@'or i=='$' or i=='#'):
 s=s+1
if (l>=1 and u>=1 and s>=1 and d>=1 and l+s+u+d==len(p)):
print("Valid Password")
else:
print("Invalid Password, Enter a new one")

6]Write a program which will perform sum and multiplication,
that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in a list of numbers.
For example, sum([1, 2, 3, 4]) should return 10, and multiply([1, 2, 3, 4]) should return 24.
